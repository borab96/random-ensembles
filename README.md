# rmt
 collection of random matrix theory generators and methods. See [notebooks](https://nbviewer.org/github/borab96/random-ensembles/nbs) for details.
 
 Currently implemented are standard random ensemble generators as well as a ginibre and Wigner-Levy generators. The implemented methods focus on spectral statistics. In partiuclar, a naive numerical unfolder is implemented to extract spectral statistics from non-standard distributions.
